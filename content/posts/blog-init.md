Watashi Ga Kita!

After almost 3 years of <span style="color:yellow">"साइट अंडर कन्स्ट्रक्शन"</span> and occassionally rick rolling people that end up on my site, finally got to a point where I know what I want from this site. Surprise Surprise yet another developer starting a blog!

I don't spend much time doing 'frontend things'; I do find it very hard. On the other hand, systems, backends and colourless terminals just seems to make a lot of sense to me. I'd have used jekyll to just get rid of these distractions and just focus on the content...but this endeavour is about self betterment, so I'm going to try to get out of my comfort zone.

So, I'm using Gridsome for this project. Simply so that I can push myself to write `Vue.js` again, after my limited interactions with it while building [Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com). I'm still a stranger to SCSS; Although I've been surrounded by it while building [Frappe](https://frappeframework.com) these past couple of years, never thought _"hey let me look at {{ wh-type questions }} this is"_. Another unknown here is GraphQL, after buzzing around me for over a year, finally this will get me a chance to explore what it all is about ;)


#### Whats next

I'm hoping to write more frequently now that I've started with this again. There's a lot I want to change about the layout and styling of this site before that. Also, will leave [Alexandr Podvalny
